This video explains the Feigenbaum constant very well.

Inspired by this video, a program was written which represents the Feigenbaum constant. In addition to that, there is also an Mandelbrot.


What is a Feigenbaum constant?
>In mathematics, specifically bifurcation theory, the Feigenbaum constants are two mathematical constants which both express ratios in a >bifurcation diagram for a non-linear map. They are named after the physicist Mitchell J. Feigenbaum.
